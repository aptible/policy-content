# Vendor Onboarding Policy

In order to ensure that we only use and contract with vendors that will maintain the security and privacy of our information and information systems, the Security Team shall onboard all vendors by doing the following:

- ensuring that the vendor meets our minimum security requirements;
- confirming that the vendor signed a valid vendor agreement;
- ensuring there is no misunderstanding between the organization and the third-party as it relates to the agreement
- including indemnity of the company and the third part in the agreement when needed
- confirming that the vendor signed any other specific contracts (like a HIPAA business associate agreement or a GDPR data processing agreement);
- adding any additional legal requirements to our Legal Requirements Log; and
- adding the vendor to the Asset Inventory.

# Security Requirements for All Vendors

## Risk Management Requirements

The Security Team shall conduct and document a risk assessment prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of information services.

The risk introduced and associated controls are reconsidered prior to purchasing the product should the security functionality in a proposed product does not satisfy the specified requirement.

Any additional functionality is disabled or mitigated through application of additional controls should the functionality pose a security risk.

## Minimum Security Requirements

In order to protect our information that is accessible by vendors, we shall only enter into service agreements with vendors that meet the following minimum security requirements:

- they design and implement controls to protect our information at a level equal to or greater than we would apply to our own data;
- they design and implement controls to mitigate and contain data security risks through proper separation of duties, role-based access, and least-privilege access for all personnel within their supply chain;
- they ensure that applicable information-security controls are integrated in all service support processes applicable to their contractual relationship with us (customer support, etc.);
- they inspect, account for, and correct data-quality errors and associated risks, as applicable;
- they make security incident information available to us;
- they ensure that their personnel supporting our information or information systems have the required skills to perform their assigned responsibilities and are aligned with internal security roles and responsibilities;
- they comply with all service-level agreements (SLAs);
- they enforce the use of VPNs where required from a risk perspective; and
- they ensure that their users and processes must be granted access with the least level of permissions necessary to perform their intended function(s).

Commercial products other than operating system software used to store and/or process covered information undergo a security assessment and/or security certification by a qualified assessor prior to implementation.

The Security Team, Privacy Team, or Legal Team shall ensure that we only use vendors that have entered into all required contracts (including those required under applicable data privacy laws and regulations).

# Security Requirements for Outsourced Software Development

Outsourced software development must meet all vendor management requirements in addition to:
- contractual requirements must exist in relation to the ownership and security of the code and application; and

- notification and/or pre-authorization of any changes controlled by the provider with customer (tenant) impacts;
- timely notification of a security incident to all customers (tenants) and other business relationships impacted;
- assessment and independent verification of compliance with agreement provisions and/or terms without posing an unacceptable business risk of exposure to the organization being assessed;
- expiration of the business relationship and treatment of customer (tenant) data impacted;
- open and published APIs are used by cloud service providers to ensure support for interoperability between components and to facilitate migrating applications;
- customer (tenant) service-to-service application (API) and data interoperability and portability requirements for application development and information exchange, usage, and integrity persistence; and
- document custom changes made to any hypervisor in use and all solution-specific virtualization hooks available


# Security Requirements for Data Center Vendors

All data-center vendors that we contract with must meet the requirements above and comply with these data-center-vendor-specific requirements.

## Asset Management

Assets must be classified in terms of business criticality, service-level expectations, and operational continuity requirements. A complete inventory of business-critical assets located at all sites and/or geographical locations and their usage over time shall be maintained and updated regularly, and assigned ownership by defined roles and responsibilities.

## Controlled Access Points

Physical security perimeters (e.g., fences, walls, barriers, guards, gates, electronic surveillance, physical authentication mechanisms, reception desks, and security patrols) shall be implemented to safeguard sensitive data and information systems.

## Equipment Identification

Automated equipment identification shall be used as a method of connection authentication. Location-aware technologies may be used to validate connection authentication integrity based on known equipment locations.

## Off-Site Authorization

Authorization must be obtained prior to relocation or transfer of hardware, software, or data to an offsite premises.

## Off-Site Equipment

Policies and procedures shall be established for the secure disposal of equipment (by asset type) used outside the organization's premises. This shall include a wiping solution or destruction process that renders the recovery of information impossible. The erasure shall consist of a full overwrite of the drive to ensure that the erased drive is released to inventory for reuse and deployment, or securely stored until it can be destroyed.

## Security Policy

Policies and procedures shall be established, and supporting business processes implemented, for maintaining a safe and secure working environment in offices, rooms, facilities, and secure areas storing sensitive information.

## Secure Area Authorization

Ingress and egress to secure areas shall be constrained and monitored by physical access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel are allowed access.

## Unauthorized Persons Entry

Ingress and egress points such as service areas and other points where unauthorized personnel may enter the premises shall be monitored, controlled, and, if possible, isolated from data storage and processing facilities to prevent unauthorized data corruption, compromise, and loss.

## User Access

Physical access to information assets and functions by users and support personnel shall be restricted.

## Data Center Utilities/Environmental Conditions

Data center utility services and environmental conditions (e.g., water, power, temperature and humidity controls, telecommunications, and internet connectivity) shall be secured, monitored, maintained, and tested for continual effectiveness at planned intervals to ensure protection from unauthorized interception or damage, and designed with automated fail-over or other redundancies in the event of planned or unplanned disruptions.

## Environmental Risks

Physical protection against damage from natural causes and disasters, as well as deliberate attacks, including fire, flood, atmospheric electrical discharge, solar-induced geomagnetic storm, wind, earthquake, tsunami, explosion, nuclear accident, volcanic activity, biological hazard, civil unrest, mudslide, tectonic activity, and other forms of natural or man-made disasters shall be anticipated, designed, and have countermeasures applied.

## Equipment Location

To reduce the risks from environmental threats, hazards, and opportunities for unauthorized access, equipment shall be kept away from locations subject to high probability environmental risks and supplemented by redundant equipment located at a reasonable distance.

## Equipment Maintenance

Policies and procedures shall be established, and supporting business processes and technical measures implemented, for equipment maintenance ensuring continuity and availability of operations and support personnel.

## Equipment Power Failures

Protection measures shall be put into place to react to natural and man-made threats based upon a geographically-specific business impact assessment.

Alternate telecommunications services that are sufficiently separated from the primary service provider shall be established with priority-of-service provisions.

# Audit Reports Demonstrating Security

Vendors that maintain a current ISO 27001 certification or that make available an unqualified SOC 2 Type 2 audit report shall be deemed to comply with the security requirements outlined above.

# Vendor Audits

## Oversight and Enforcement

The Security Team shall ensure that all vendors meet our vendor security requirements prior to their use. If the Security Team determines that a vendor does not meet our requirements, it may propose an alternate vendor.

In order to ensure that our vendors continue to meet our security and legal requirements, we shall audit our vendors at least annually. During this audit, the Asset Owner for each vendor shall work with the Legal Team (as needed) to:

- ensure that the vendor continues to meet our minimum security requirements;
- confirm that all contracts with the vendor are still valid, sufficient, and SLAs are being met; and
- update the Asset Inventory and the Legal Requirements Log (if needed).

## Progress Meetings

If required by the SLA regular progress meetings should be conducted to review reports, audit trails, security events, operational issues, failures and disruptions. Identified problems/issues should be investigated and resolved within an agreed upon timeline.

# Vendor Service Changes

Workforce members must report changes to the provision of services by vendors to the relevant asset owners listed in the Asset Inventory. The Security Team or the Legal Team shall ensure that the vendor still meets our minimum vendor security requirements in light of the service change.

Asset owners must coordinate with the Legal Team to ensure that changes are approved and documented in the Vendor Inventory.

# Vendor Termination

In order to ensure the security and privacy of our information and information systems, we shall timely offboard vendors with whom we no longer have a business relationship.

To do so, the asset owner (identified in the Asset Inventory) or the Security Team shall do the following.

- revoke the vendor’s access to our information and information systems;
- ensure that the information stored with vendor is deleted or exported; and
- log the termination.
