# Pre-employment

Hiring activity for workforce members must be coordinated through the Legal Team prior to their start dates. New hires must be communicated to the Security Team, which is responsible for managing and auditing access to company information and information systems.

# Workforce Onboarding
All workforce members shall be onboarded in a way that ensures the security and privacy of company information and information systems. Onboarding for new workforce members must contain at least the following steps:

- confirm that we performed necessary background screening (including professional-reference checks and criminal-background screening as needed), consistent with all applicable laws and regulations;
- ensure that the new workforce member has signed the required agreements (including employment agreements and NDAs);
- assign the workforce member to the correct role in Aptible Comply and granting him or her the necessary access to our information systems;

# Training Requirements

In order to ensure that our workforce members are trained to meet their security and privacy obligations, we have created a training program that assigns required courses based on ISMS role. Workforce members are required to complete security and privacy training as follows:

- **Security Awareness and Insider Threat Training:** all workforce members
- **Developer-specific Training:** the Engineering Team
- **Incident Response Training:** the Incident Response Team
- **Business Continuity Training:** the Service Reliability Team
- **Culture and Security Training:** the Management Team and the Security Team
- **Risk Management Training:** the Management Team and the Security Team

The Security Team is responsible for ensuring that all workforce members are assigned the correct training courses and that all workforce members complete their training in accordance with the schedule described below.

Upon completion of each training course, workforce members shall complete an attestation that they received, understood, and will comply with the training.

# Training Schedules

Workforce members must complete their required training courses on the following schedule:

- when they join the workforce or are assigned a role with additional training requirements;
- within sixty (60) days of hire;
- at least annually after they complete the initial training; and
- as operational or environmental circumstances change.

The Security Officer shall determine whether sufficient cause exists to modify training or re-train workforce members in response to operational or environmental changes, and the Management Team may approve further training recommendations. Factors that may trigger re-training include, but are not limited to:

- security or privacy incidents that result in recommended remedial training for one or more workforce members;
- adoption of new technology; and
- material changes in organizational policies.

# Documentation of Training Records 

All training records shall be documented and retained for at least six years.
- issue the workforce member work devices as needed; and
- assign the workforce member the appropriate training.

The Human Resources Team shall ensure that all information collected during the recruitment process (including the results of background checks) are classified as restricted information, the access to which is strictly limited.

The Human Resources Team shall retain background screening documentation for workforce members indefinitely as part of their employment records. The Human Resources Team shall retain background screening documentation for terminated workforce members, applicants, and contractors for six years.

# Employee Transfers
Workforce member transfers or promotions must be initiated for approval and coordinated through the Legal Team prior to the actual date of the transition.

All logical and physical access controls for all transfers must be reassessed and reconfigured within 30 days of the transfer, to align with the workforce memberâ€™s new role and responsibilities. Workforce members shall not retain privileges from the previous position unless the new position requires the same access. All exceptions must be specifically approved by management and the Security Team.

When a workforce member transfers to a new role, their membership on administrative committees, their membership in email distribution lists and chat groups, their responsibilities (and affiliated training requirements), and all assets allocated to them must be reevaluated.

# Workforce Sanctions
A duress alarm is provided whereby a person under duress can indicate such problems and responded to accordingly by the Human Resources Team.

Workforce members who violate the ISMS may be subject to sanctions. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, retraining, reassignment, separation, and referral to law enforcement.

If the potential violation of the ISMS occurs, the Human Resources Team shall immediately notify and work with the Security Team and the involved workforce member's manager to open a sanctions investigation to determine whether any actions should be taken.

To complete a sanctions investigation, the Human Resources Team shall do the following:

- investigate whether a violation occurred and whether a proper sanctions investigation should occur;
- assess the scope of the violation (by working with individuals with knowledge of the violation as well as the involved workforce member's manager);
- select a disciplinary action if needed based on, at least, the nature and impact of the violation; and
- provide the involved workforce member with an opportunity to appeal the decision made.

# Employee Separations
An automated notification is sent to the Human Resources Team whenever a workforce member leaves the company. The Human Resources Team shall promptly offboard the workforce member by doing the following:

- ensuring that the workforce member's access to all company information and information systems is timely revoked;
- ensuring that the workforce member returns all devices issued to him or her;
- working with the Security Team to ensure that any assets for which the separating workforce member was the owner of are reassigned to new owners;
- scheduling and holding an exit interview with the separating workforce members; and
- ensuring that during the exit interview with the workforce member, he or she is reminded of his or her ongoing security obligations (such as to maintain the confidentiality of all company information), if any.

The Human Resources Team shall coordinate all workforce-member separations with the Legal Team prior to the actual separation date. Contractor terminations must be coordinated with the Legal Team if the contract ends early.
