Use of company information assets is subject to the following restrictions:

- all information assets must be used for their intended or authorized purposes only;
- any use for unintended or unauthorized purposes requires the advance approval of the Security Officer and the Security Team;
- all mobile information assets are required to be secured pursuant to the Mobile Device Security; and
