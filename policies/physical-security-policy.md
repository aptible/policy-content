# Maintaining a Security Perimeter

In order to protect the physical spaces in our office that contain our information systems, including those that store or process Sensitive/Regulated, Restricted, or Confidential Information, we shall maintain a security perimeter that restricts access to those areas. Our security perimeter shall make use of the following security safeguards:

- the physical security perimeter should be secure and not contain gaps through which a break-in could easily occur;
- spaces shall be configured to prevent Sensitive/Regulated or Restricted Information from being visible or audible from outside the perimeter;
- physical access to the security perimeter shall be controlled;
- access to Sensitive/Regulated, Restricted, or Confidential Information shall be restricted to individuals who have been authorized to access such information;
- intrusion-detection systems shall be installed and maintained (as needed);
- areas that contain Sensitive/Regulated, Restricted, or Confidential Information shall be designed such that you cannot see the information from outside the area; and
- delivery and loading areas shall be monitored.

# Protection Against External and Environmental Threats

The Security Team shall consider whether changes to our security perimeter should be made in order to ensure that we are protected from environmental threats such as fires, floods, earthquakes, and other natural and man made disasters.

# Securing Work Areas

In order to ensure that work areas are secured, the Security Team shall implement the following safeguards:

- vacant areas that contain nonpublic information should be locked and monitored;
- recording devices should not be allowed in areas with Sensitive/Regulated Information without prior approval from the Security Team;
- unsupervised work in secure areas should be minimized;
- access to delivery and loading areas should be restricted to authorized personnel;
- the doors to any delivery or loading area should not be open if the doors to the internal security perimeter are open; and
- any materials coming into our physical perimeter should be logged and recorded in the Asset Inventory, if appropriate.

# Authorizations to access spaces

In order to ensure that only authorized individuals access our physical spaces that contain information systems that store or process Sensitive/Regulated, Restricted, or Confidential Information, we shall ensure that all individuals (including visitors) who enter our physical spaces are authorized to do so. Doors to internal secure areas lock automatically, implement a door delay alarm, and should be equipped with electronic locks.

To do so, the Security Team shall:

- create and maintain a list of individuals who are authorized to access spaces where Sensitive/Regulated, Restricted, or Confidential Information are stored or processed;
- ensure that only authorized individuals access areas where Sensitive/Regulated, Restricted, or Confidential Information are stored or processed (for visitors, this means that the appropriate workforce member and the Security Team have approved the visit);
- ensure that authorized individuals wear a badge or otherwise indicate that they are permitted to access specific areas; and
- revoke authorizations when they are no longer needed.

In order to ensure the accuracy of the list of individuals who are authorized to access areas where Sensitive/Regulated, Restricted, or Confidential Information are stored or processed, the Security Team shall review the list at least quarterly.

# Visitors access records

When a visitor enter the security perimeter, a record shall be created that includes the following information:

- the name of the visitor;
- confirmation that the visitor's identification was verified;
- the date of the visitor’s access;
- the visitor’s entry and departure times; and
- the purpose of the visit.

In order to ensure that all physical access was appropriate, the Security Team shall review the visitor access records at least monthly. If it identifies any inappropriate access, it shall immediately report that access to the Incident Response Team.

# Monitoring

The company shall actively monitor unoccupied areas at all times and sensitive and/or restricted areas in real time as appropriate for the area.

Intrusion detection systems (e.g., alarms and surveillance equipment) shall be:
- installed on all external doors and accessible windows;
- monitored for alerts and alarms; and
- investigated when alerts and alarmed are triggered.

# Equipment Security

All equipment that can access company information or information systems shall be located in areas in order to avoid environmental threats and unauthorized access.

# Maintenance

In order to ensure that we protect our information during maintenance activities, we shall take the following steps to ensure that physical equipment is properly maintained and to ensure that the equipment’s availability and integrity:

- equipment shall be maintained in accordance with supplier and manufacturer guidance;
- maintenance of physical equipment shall only be completed by trained personnel;
- data shall be removed from equipment prior to being taken off the premises;
- maintenance support and/or spare parts for defined key information system components are obtained within the applicable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) specified in the Business Impact Analysis
- equipment that is maintained by external parties shall be tested to ensure the equipment has not been tampered with and does not malfunction; 
- non-local maintenance and diagnostic activities shall be monitored and controlled;
- non-local system maintenance is prohibited unless explicitly authorized, in writing, by the Security Officer; and
- after maintenance by an external party, equipment shall be tested to ensure that the equipment has not been tampered with and does not malfunction. 

# Supporting Utilities

We shall take precautions to protect our equipment from power failures and other disruptions caused by a failure in a supporting utility (electricity, telecommunications, water, gas, ventilation, etc.), by ensuring the following:

- equipment that stores or processes Sensitive/Regulated Information shall have access to backup utilities;
- supporting utilities shall have emergency cutoffs located near emergency exits or cable rooms; and
- supporting utilities shall be regularly inspected if deemed necessary.

# Cable Security

We shall take the following steps to ensure that power and telecommunications cables that carry any form of information are protected from interception, interference, and damage:

- power and telecommunication lines that run into the security perimeter shall be underground or subject to alternative forms of protection;
- power cables shall be segregated from communication cables; and
- access to patch panels and cable rooms shall be restricted to cleared personnel.

# Security of Off-Premises Equipment

Equipment may be taken off-site only with the Security Officer’s prior authorization. When equipment is taken off-site, We shall log the following information in the Asset Inventory:

- the date the equipment was moved outside the security perimeter;
- the date the equipment is returned;
- the chain of custody of the equipment; and
- the name of the organization responsible for protecting the equipment.

When equipment is taken off-site, the individual responsible for the equipment shall ensure the following:

- the equipment is not left alone in public places;
- the equipment’s manufacturer’s instructions for protecting the equipment are followed at all times; and
- safeguards should be implemented for the equipment based on the risks associated with the particular facts related to moving of the equipment off-site.

We shall minimize the amount of data on equipment taken outside of the security perimeter.

# Secure Storage, Disposal and Reuse of Equipment

Surplus equipment shall be stored securely while not in use.

Equipment shall containing Sensitive/Regulated, Restricted, and Confidential Information shall be sanitized before the equipment is disposed of or repurposed.

Measures should be taken to minimize the aggregation effect, which may cause a large quantity of non-covered information to become covered through accumulation of media for disposal.

If equipment is damaged and information cannot be wiped from it, the Security Team shall analyze the risks involved, and shall determine whether the equipment should be physically destroyed or sent for repair.



# Change Management

Combinations and keys for organization-defined high-risk entry/exit points shall be changed when lost or stolen or combinations are compromised.

# Physical Data Processing

Workforce members may only store or process company information on mobile devices that are permitted under, and that meet the requirements of, our Mobile Device Security policies or with cloud-computing vendors that meet the requirements of our Vendor Security policies. Otherwise storing company information on, or processing company information with, other systems is strictly prohibited.

Access to all diagnostic and maintenance ports must be securely controlled with the use of a key lock or related measures, in conjunction with effective procedures.
