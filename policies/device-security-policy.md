- the device operating system is fully patched and up to date; and
- the device is not jailbroken.

## Required Security Configurations for Mobile Phones and Tablets

All mobile phones and tablets that access company information or information systems, including BYOD devices, must be configured with the following security configurations.

- short screensaver lockout (after no more than 2 minutes of inactivity) is enabled;
- network sessions are terminated after 30 minutes of inactivity;

- the device is configured to allow for remote software version/patch validation
- MAC address authentication and static IP addresses are implemented;
- the device operating system is fully patched and up to date; and
- the device is not jailbroken.

## High Risk Travel Requirement
Prior to traveling to a location deemed as high risk by the Security Team, mobile devices should be reviewed for security configurations. Upon returning from high risk locations, devices should be checked for malware and physical tampering.

## Device Backups and Data Storage Policy

Workforce members may not use cloud-based backup/storage services to store company information unless preapproved by the Security Team.

## Approved Operating Systems

Workforce members may only access company information and information systems using devices with the following operating systems: macOS and iOS.

## Prohibited Software

The Security Team shall approve the use of all software installed on devices used to connect to company information or information systems, as described in the Asset Management Policy.

The Security Team shall identify unauthorized (blacklisted) software on the information system, including servers, workstations and laptops. The security team shall employ an allow-all, deny-by-exception policy to prohibit the execution of known unauthorized (blacklisted) software on the information system. The Security Team shall review and update the list of unauthorized (blacklisted) software annually.

# Device Audits

In order to ensure that all mobile devices that are capable of accessing company information or information systems—including BYOD devices—meet our security-configuration requirements, the Security Team shall perform recurring audits of them. During a mobile-device audit, the Security Team shall compare each device's security settings to our security-configuration requirements to make sure that all requirements are met. The organization shall also monitor for unauthorized connections to the information system by mobile devices. The Security Team reviews and updates the list of unauthorized (blacklisted) software on an annual basis.

# Network Scans
Network scans shall be performed quarterly to identify unauthorized components/devices.


# Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)

Workforce members may access the company's information and information systems on their own devices (“BYOD devices”) as long as the BYOD devices meet the requirements of our Mobile Device Security policies.

Workforce members who use BYOD devices should be aware that:

they have no expectation of privacy when using BYOD devices for work;
BYOD devices may become subject to holds for litigation or legal investigation, in which case the workforce member will lose access to the device, possibly indefinitely; and
if the BYOD device needs to be wiped, personal data may be lost.

# Clear Desk and Screen Policy

Workforce members shall avoid inadvertently exposing Sensitive/Regulated Information, Restricted Information, and Confidential Information by allowing it to be viewed by unauthorized individuals.

When Sensitive/Regulated Information, Restricted Information, and Confidential Information is not in use, all workforce members shall:

- close sources of information being displayed on a computer;
- secure all media, notes, and hard copy information at the end of a work shift, when not in use, or when away from the immediate area; and
- ensure that copies of information are properly disposed of when leaving a shared area, such as a conference room.

The display screens for all devices used to access Sensitive/Regulated Information, Restricted Information, or Confidential Information must not be viewable from outside the immediate work area. Unauthorized viewing from windows and hallways, or by employees without access rights to the same information, should be avoided.

If an unauthorized person enters an area where Sensitive/Regulated Information, Restricted Information, or Confidential Information is present, the present workforce members shall immediately take steps to conceal the information, including by:

- activating a screen saver or minimizing the window containing the information on a computer display; or
- hiding or covering hard copy information with other material.

# Antivirus and Antispam Software Selection

In order to ensure that endpoint devices are protected, the Security Officer shall ensure that antivirus/antimalware and anti-spam software is installed on them. This applies to all entry/exit points to the network. To ensure that workforce members cannot interfere with the functioning of the software, the Security Officer shall select antivirus software that can be centrally managed and that cannot disabled by end users. The selected software should be kept up-to-date as new versions are made available.

## Continuous or Periodic Monitoring

The antivirus software must be configured to continuously or periodically run full-system scans on all workforce member devices. At a minimum scans for malicious software must be performed on boot and every 12 hours. If malware or malicious code is detected during a scan, it must be immediately quarantined or deleted and an alert must be sent to the Security Team.

The Security Team shall review notifications of malware on company information systems in order to minimize the effects of false positives on the availability on company information systems. Lessons learned from monitoring should be included in security and awareness training.

## Retention of Scan Results

The Security Officer shall ensure that logs from antivirus scans are maintained for at least one year.

## Change Management

As systems change and IT infrastructure is updated the chosen antivirus tool should be evaluated to confirm it still compatible and up to date.

# Removable Media

Removable media shall not be used to store Sensitive/Regulated Information unless an exception is specifically authorized in writing by the Security Officer, the exception is logged in the ISMS Exceptions, and the media device has an identifiable owner. Requirements of the Encryption and Key Management may not be waived.

"Removable media" means media that are used to store electronic data, and includes, but is not limited to:

- magnetic media (e.g. tapes, floppies, hard drives, etc.);
- optical media (CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray Disks);
- flash drives (thumb drives, SD Cards); and
- any other media that may be read by a computer.
