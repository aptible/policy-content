# Segregation of Duties

# Security Awareness
In order to ensure that workforce members are aware of their security responsibilities, the following information shall be clearly specified in all job descriptions or defined in contractual terms and conditions:

- the workforce member's responsibilities with regard to the security of company information or information systems (which may continue after the end of the employment on contractual relationship); and

# Complaints
All workforce members may make complaints to the Security Team about the ISMS or compliance with it. The Security Team shall review all complaints submitted and respond to them as needed. The Security Team shall also document complaints received as needed (as, for example, ISMS improvements, incidents, nonconformities, or exceptions).

In order to meet our obligations and manage risk, it is critical that we understand, track, and comply with all of our relevant statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements.

To do so, the Legal Team shall maintain the Legal and Contractual Requirements Log, which should include the following:

all state and federal laws relevant to information security (including privacy and data-protection laws), regulatory frameworks and requirements, and regulatory reporting requirements; and
all contractual requirements, including master service agreements and custom business-associate agreements.

The Security Team shall disseminate information to our workforce more broadly as needed.


# Annual Review Meeting
At least annually, the Management Team shall hold an ISMS review meeting to review and update the ISMS. This helps us ensure that:

- the ISMS is aligned with our objectives;
- the ISMS is designed properly to meet our requirements; and
- the ISMS is integrated into our business processes, accounts for security incidents, and is continually improved.

During each ISMS review meeting, the Management Team shall review at least the following:

- the status of decisions made at the previous ISMS review meeting;
- changes in our ISMS context;
- changes to our ISMS scope;
- changes to our ISMS objectives, metrics, or plan to achieve our objectives;
- the performance of the ISMS since the last ISMS review meeting;
- other opportunities for improvements to the ISMS.

The Security Officer shall ensure that prior to the meeting, the Management Team receives the information listed above, as well as all relevant information gathered from security or privacy incidents, our risk assessment, our vendor review, and our vulnerability-management program.

The Management Team shall make edits to the ISMS based on the ISMS review meeting, and shall approve a new version of the ISMS at the close of the meeting.

As part of this review, the Management Team shall also update our ISMS objectives and our plan to achieve them.

# ISMS Reviews and Improvements
In order to ensure that the ISMS is suitable, adequate, and effective, we shall review and update the ISMS at least annually. To do so, the Security Team shall ensure that each individual or role that is designated as a control owner shall review and propose changes (if needed) to each internal control.

As part of this review, the control owners should also identify improvements that should be made to the ISMS in order to continually improve the suitability and effectiveness of the ISMS. When reviewing our internal controls, reviewers should consider the following:

- our ISMS context and scope;
- our recent risk assessments; and
- any security or privacy incidents we've experienced since the last review.

All improvements to our processes should be tracked through the Comply ticketing system.

# Exception Management

The Security Officer may occasionally approve an exception to the ISMS. In approving an exception, the Security Officer shall first analyze the potential risk related to the exception. Only exceptions that have a minimal risk shall be approved.

All exceptions must be given a "due date," which indicates the anticipated latest date that the exception will be open. The Security Team must review exceptions—and attempt to close them out—prior to their due dates.

When an exception is approved, the Security Officer shall document the following:

- the exception;
- the basis for the exception;
- a due date for revisiting the exception; and
- an owner who is responsible for closing out the exception.

The Security Team shall review all exceptions during its monthly meeting, and close out all exceptions by their due date.

# Nonconformity Management

In order to ensure that the ISMS is effective, we shall continuously monitor for nonconformities (that is, violations of any of the requirements of the ISMS). Nonconformities may be identified in a number of ways, including from security incidents, internal and independent audits (if applicable), and customer or workforce member complaints.

When a nonconformity is identified, we shall manage it by logging it, immediately identifying the actions that we need to take to correct it, and reviewing our response to it to ensure it is not repeated.

# Control of ISMS Documents

In order to ensure the effectiveness of the ISMS, we shall control documented information related to the ISMS as described below.

## Identification of ISMS Documents

All documents that make up the ISMS shall include the following information in text or metadata (including in the revision history for the document):

- title;
- a unique version number or "tag";
- name of the author (the individual who drafted or edited the document);
- name of the approver or approval authority where it is not the Management Team;
- date of approval; and
- a brief description of the changes made (if applicable).

For documents approved in Aptible Comply, these fields may be present in the Activity History of the ISMS or related documents.

## ISMS Document Version Controlling

We version-control ISMS documents. Version information may include a number indicating the version and release of the particular document (like v1.0 or v3.3). The version indicator together with the approval date are used to determine the current version of each ISMS document.

Every ISMS document shall have an accompanying revision history that shows the changes made since the last approved version.

## Format of ISMS Documents

We prefer that documents related to the ISMS be kept in Aptible Comply if possible.

## Availability and Communication of ISMS Documents

We control documents related to the ISMS to ensure that they are available, suitable for use when needed, and protected.

The ISMS shall be available to all workforce members. Documents related to the ISMS (including workflows and logs) shall be made available to teams based on their need. Individuals and teams with access to the ISMS and related documents shall be notified when a new version of the document is released. This may be located in the metadata of the ISMS document.

Non-workforce members who need access to company information or information systems shall be given access to relevant ISMS controls prior to their access.

## ISMS Document Retention

We shall maintain the ISMS and the External ISMS Documents for at least six years.
