In order to ensure that we can effectively protect our information and information systems, we shall maintain an Asset Inventory that includes all of our applications, SaaS systems, databases and storage systems, individuals and teams, vendors, code repositories, and devices (laptops, mobile phones, tablets, etc.).

# Approval of the Use of Assets

The Security Team shall approve the use of new assets, including SaaS systems, prior to their use.

# Adding Assets

Whenever we add a new application, database, or SaaS system, the asset owner shall ensure that it is added to the Asset Inventory along with the following information:

- the name of the asset;
- the owner of the asset;
- a description of the asset;
- the purpose of the asset;
- the asset's status (including whether Active or Inactive);
- the highest classification level of the data that the asset will store, process, or transmit;
- the impact on our organization if we were to lose the use of the asset;
- the impact that we would suffer if we were to lose the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the asset (or its data);
- the asset's business-continuity properties (Maximum Tolerable Downtime, Recovery Point Objective, and Recovery Time Objective), if applicable; and
- the workforce members and teams that are authorized to access the asset.

Whenever we add a new endpoint device (like mobile phones, laptops, or tablets), the Human Resources Team shall ensure that it is added to the Asset Inventory along with the following information:

- the name of the device;
- the owner of the device (the Human Resources Team if it is a company-issued device, or the workforce member if it's a BYOD device);
- the model and serial number (if applicable); and
- the individual whom the device was assigned to (i.e., the person using the device).

Vendors should be added to the Asset Inventory in accordance with the Vendor Onboarding Policy.

# Retiring Assets

When an asset is being retired, the Asset Owner or the Security Team shall:

- wipe the asset of data;
- ensure that the asset is returned to the Security Team (if applicable); and
- mark the asset as Inactive in the Asset Inventory.

# Recurring Asset Inventory Reviews

The Security Team shall ensure that the Asset Inventory is reviewed in its entirety at least annually. As part of this review, the Security Team shall ensure that all assets are listed in the Asset Inventory and that all the properties listed for the assets are accurate.
