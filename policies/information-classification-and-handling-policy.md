# Information Classification

We shall classify all information that we store, process, or transmit into one of the classification levels defined below. Unclassified information shall be treated as the highest level.

## Sensitive/Regulated Information

“Sensitive/Regulated Information” means information protected by international, federal, state, or local laws or regulations, or industry standards, and includes, for example, state data-protection laws, HIPAA/HITECH, the GDPR, PCI-DSS, and Executive Order 13556 (related to controlled unclassified information (CUI).

The Legal Team is responsible for determining whether particular information created, received, maintained, processed, or transmitted by us constitutes Sensitive/Regulated Information.

## Restricted Information

“Restricted Information” means internal information that is sensitive in nature and restricted in its use and distribution. Access to this information shall be limited to only authorized workforce members on a need-to-know basis. The exposure of this information could reduce our competitive advantage, cause significant damage to our interests, or expose us to legal consequences. This information may be regulated by contractual agreements (e.g. NDA provisions) or other legal or regulatory requirements. Examples of this information include, but are not limited to:

- private information such as contracts, employee personal information, sensitive business partner information, business proposals, strategies, marketing plans, market conditions data, financial data or processes, source code, technical data, security metrics and reports, audit reports, formulae, programs, processes, etc.;
- customer lists, contact information, or sensitive customer data;
- information from and concerning vendors, including (but not limited to) vendor pricing lists and sales agreements, unless prior written approval has been given by the vendor; and
- information from and concerning any third party (including but not limited to customers) with which we do business, unless prior written approval has been given by the third party.

## Confidential Information

“Confidential Information” means information that may only be used or distributed internally. Confidential Information is intended for the use of our workforce members (or, in appropriate instances, business partners) when conducting business. This includes, but is not limited to:

- operational business information and reports;
- information which is created or discovered by or on our behalf, scheduled for development, or currently under development;
- information known by or conveyed to us which may have commercial value in our business;
- information which is typically handled in the normal course of our business, including (but not limited to) interoffice memos and communication, corporate policies and standards, contact directories, organizational charts, and other similar information.

## Public Information

“Public Information” means information that is not confidential and can be shared with external parties. While Public Information may be shared with any recipient, it has high integrity requirements and information should thus be properly vetted by appropriate members of the Management Team prior to exposure to the public. Examples include:

- press releases;
- advertising;
- reports intended for public distribution;
- information posted to our Internet-facing public web sites.

# Information Labeling

Labels are visual reminders on information to provide individuals with an indication as to the sensitivity of the information. Data that meets a classification criteria outlined in the Information Classification Policy must be treated appropriately, regardless of labeling.

Asset owners of assets containing Sensitive/Regulated Information or Restricted Information shall label those assets so that the assets display their sensitivity levels. This may include, for example, by indicating the data classification in filenames or with watermarks.

Asset owners of assets containing Confidential Information may label those assets so that the assets display their sensitivity levels.

# Data Retention

We shall define data-retention schedules on a per asset basis, which depends on the type of information being stored as well as our purposes for processing the information. The Security Team shall ensure that all Asset Owners define asset-specific data-retention schedules in the Asset Inventory.

Sensitive/Regulated Information shall be retained only for as long as required.

# Data Disposal Requirements

Each asset owner shall establish data-disposal procedures for their assigned assets. The disposal procedures must be consistent with the data's retention schedule. Disposal procedures must also ensure that all Sensitive/Regulated Information, Restricted Information, and Confidential Information are disposed of in a secure manner. When in doubt, information should be considered Sensitive/Regulated Information for disposal purposes.

Each asset owner must ensure that disposal methods adhere to any compliance, regulatory, contractual, and organizational requirements and they must also maintain accurate records of all disposal activities.

Data-disposal schedules and maintained in the Asset Inventory.

# Disposal of Hard Copies

Physical materials awaiting disposal, regardless of form or media (disks, hard copy documents, etc.), must be secured so they cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals.

# E-discovery Exception

The company must suspend disposal of any information asset if the information contained within it is subject of an existing or pending investigation, subpoena, or audit. Destruction of this information to conceal it from investigation may be a criminal offense.

# Re-use of Electronic Media

The Security Officer shall overwrite electronic media leaving the company's control with zeros before re-use. Electronic media that is to be re-used within the company does not require special treatment.
