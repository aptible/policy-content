# Overview

To ensure that our policies, procedures, and controls conform to our compliance requirements and are being effectively implemented and maintained, we shall complete internal and external audits. Audits should be planed and executed in ways that minimize disruptions to business processes.

Opportunities for improvement and non-conformities with policies, procedures, or controls identified shall be documented and addressed.

# Internal Audits

To ensure that the ISMS conforms to our compliance requirements and is being effectively implemented and maintained, we shall complete an internal audit at least annually. We shall plan internal audits in a way that minimizes disruptions to business processes.

If as a result of the internal audit we identify improvements we should make to the ISMS, or nonconformities with the requirements of our ISMS that need to be addressed, we shall track and implement responses to them in accordance with our policies.


# Nonconformity Management

In order to ensure that the ISMS is effective, we shall continuously monitor for nonconformities (that is, violations of any of the requirements of the ISMS). Nonconformities may be identified in a number of ways, including from security incidents, internal and independent audits (if applicable), and customer or workforce member complaints.

When a nonconformity is identified, we shall manage it by logging it, immediately identifying the actions that we need to take to correct it, and reviewing our response to it to ensure it is not repeated.
