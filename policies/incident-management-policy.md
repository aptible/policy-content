# Overview
The Incident Response Team shall respond to all potential or actual security or privacy incidents in accordance with our Incident Response Playbooks (if available) and the Incident Response Plan.

The Incident Response Program includes, but is not limited to the following:

- a cross-discipline Incident Response Team;
- includes roles, responsibilities and tools for handling, reporting, communicating and performing forensic analysis;
- accounts and prepares the company for a variety of incidents, including insider threat;  
- a point of contact for coordinating information security event responses;
-  process/mechanism to anonymously report security issues;
- Intrusion Detection/ Information Protection system (IDS/IPS) alerts are utilized for reporting information security events;
- incident logs, audit trails, and evidence is secured, system and data access controlled, emergency actions documented, actions reported to management, and system and control integrity is confirmed.

We reserve the right to take disciplinary action against workforce members that fail to cooperate with federal and state investigations. 

# Training and Exercises
In order to ensure that we are prepared to respond to all potential and actual security and privacy incidents, the Incident Response Team shall routinely be trained on our Incident Response Plan. Additionally, the Incident Response Team shall routinely complete the following incident response exercises:

- **tabletop exercises**, the output of which consists of Incident Response Playbooks that can be used to respond to potential future security and privacy incidents.

# Mandatory Reporting
Workforce members must immediately report privacy and security incidents to the Security Officer or the Incident Response Team. This includes, e.g., violations of the ISMS, suspicious computing events, policy violations, security weaknesses, and human resources events.

Workforce members should immediately call 911 emergency services if an incident involves the threat of imminent physical harm (including, e.g., fires, earthquakes, gas leaks, active shooters, etc.). Workforce members should report non-urgent threats of harm or safety issues to their managers, and should escalate up the chain of command if necessary.

Workforce members must immediately report suspected or actual violations of criminal law to the Legal Team and the Security Officer for referral to law enforcement.

# No Retaliation Against Whistleblowers Policy

We shall not retaliate against, intimidate, or harass individuals, including workforce members, who report suspected or known security incidents that may jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, or availability, or privacy of our information, information systems, or facilities.

We strictly prohibit attempts to interfere with, prevent, or obstruct the reporting of security or privacy incidents, and may discipline individuals who attempt to do so. We shall protect the identity of individuals who report incidents unless a government agency or court of law requires the disclosure of the whistleblower’s identity.

# Incident Response Plan

## Concept of Operations

This plan is designed to structure our investigation and resolution of privacy and security incidents using a three-phase approach. We shall follow this Incident Response Plan, or a specific Incident Response Playbooks, in responding to all privacy and security incidents.

## Incident Response Planning

We shall plan our response to security and privacy incidents by developing this Incident Response Plan, developing the Incident Response Playbooks (as described in the Incident Response Training and Testing Policy), and applying security controls for critical information systems.

## Business Impact Analysis

The Incident Response Team shall prioritize its responses to multiple incidents based on:

- the criticality of the affected assets; and
- the current or potential adverse effect.

A full business impact analysis, including FIPS 199 security impact categorization levels for each information system component, is located in the Asset Inventory.

# Dependencies

During the incident response process, the Incident Response Team shall communicate via the following methods/tools:

- Slack
- Email
- Phone

## Incident Response Phases

### Phase 1: Identification and Notification

#### Activation Criteria

The identification phase is focused on detecting whether an actual security or privacy incident took place. In this phase, the responder shall attempt to gain an understanding of the nature of the incident and to make a determination whether the incident is real (and not a false positive).

#### Notification Procedures

If the event is not a false positive, or the responder is unable to make a determination, the responder shall immediately notify the Incident Response Team and the Security Officer via email or phone.

#### Assessment

The Incident Response Team shall assess the scope and nature of the incident by identifying and reviewing the following:

- the type of incident;
- the criticality of the affected assets;
- the sensitivity of the affected data; and
- the impact the incident will have on our organization.

#### Documentation

The Incident Response Team shall document the following information about the incident:

- the name of the incident;
- the date of the incident;
- the date of discovery of the incident;
- the type of incident (e.g., availability, denial of service, unauthorized access);
- a summary description of the incident;
- the severity of the incident (test, low, medium, high, or critical);
- the current status of the incident (new, in progress, forwarded for investigation, resolved, etc.);
- actions taken by all members of the Incident Response Team;
- evidence gathered during the incident investigation (as attachments, logs file, screenshots, etc.);
- chain of custody, if applicable; and
- the next steps to be taken (e.g., rebuild a server, upgrade an application).

### Phase 2: Containment and Eradication

Next, the Incident Response Team shall contain and eradicate the incident by taking actions to limit and mitigate the effects of the incident. Incident Response Playbooks should clearly identify the steps that should be taken to limit and mitigate the effects of the incident. For computing incidents, these steps may include (but are not limited to) system backup, network disablement or reconfiguration, or completely disabling the computing resource. For policy incidents, these steps may include terminating system or physical access for an individual.

### Phase 3: Post-Incident Activity

#### Reporting

The Security Officer or a member of the Legal Team shall report the incident to the relevant government offices, business partners, media outlets, and law enforcement agencies if required by a contract, statute, or regulation. This includes reporting all breaches as required under contracts or state breach-notification laws.

The Legal Team shall ensure that, to the extent possible, the notification includes the following information in easily understood language:

- the identification of each individual whose information was or might have been accessed, acquired, used, or disclosed as a result of the incident;
- a brief description of the incident;
- the date of the incident;
- the date of our discovery of the incident (if known);
- a description of the types of unsecured data that were involved in the incident;
- any steps individuals should take to protect themselves from potential harm resulting from the incident; and
- our contact information.

#### Review and Prevention

Once the incident is fully mitigated, the Incident Response Team shall review the incident and its own response to the incident, to determine if steps need to be taken to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

The Incident Response Lead and the Security Officer should determine whether to create a specific Incident Response Playbook to assist in the response to this kind of incident in the future.

As needed, the Security Team shall:

- conduct any follow-up notifications, via a status page or to customers directly;
- clean up any extra resources provisioned during the response;
- assign post-mortem responsibilities; and
- identify and document any gaps or inefficiencies in handling of the incident.

### Sanctions Investigations

If the incident resulted from a workforce member's violation of the ISMS, the Human Resources Team shall conduct a sanctions investigation if deemed necessary.


# GDPR Breach Reporting

If as a result of a security or privacy incident we experience a breach of personal data, we will report the breach as follows.

## Reporting to a supervisory authority

If we suffer a breach of personal data and we are the controller of the data, the Security Team and the Privacy Team shall determine whether the breach is likely to result in a **risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons** by reviewing the following:

- the type of breach (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, or availability);
- the nature, sensitivity, and volume of personal data (the higher the sensitivity of the data, the higher the risk of harm to the data subjects);
- the ease of identification of the individuals;
- the severity of consequences for individuals (including, e.g., looking at who has access to the data and for what purpose);
- the special characteristics of the individuals;
- special characteristics of ours (its nature and role); and
- the number of affected individuals.

If the Security Team and the Privacy Team determine that the breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the Privacy Officer shall notify the supervisory authority of the country in which we have designated an Article 27 representative of the following information:

- the nature of the data breach;
- if possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects whose data was involved in the breach;
- the name and contact details of the our Data Protection Officer or another contact point from whom more information can be obtained;
- the likely consequences of the data breach; and
- the measures that ours will or might take to address the personal data breach.

The Privacy Team shall ensure that the relevant supervisory authority is notified no later than 72 hours after we became aware of the breach (unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons).

## Reporting a breach to the data subjects

If we suffer a breach of personal data and we are the controller of the data, the Security Team and the Privacy Team shall determine whether the breach is likely to result in a **high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons** by reviewing the following:

- the type of breach (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, or availability);
- the nature, sensitivity, and volume of personal data (the higher the sensitivity of the data, the higher the risk of harm to the data subjects);
- the ease of identification of the individuals;
- the severity of consequences for individuals (including, e.g., looking at who has access to the data and for what purpose);
- the special characteristics of the individuals;
- special characteristics of ours (its nature and role); and
- the number of affected individuals.

If the Security Team and the Privacy Team determine that the breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the Security Team and the Privacy Team shall notify the data subjects of the following information in clear and plain language:

- the nature of the personal data breach;
- the name and contact details of our Data Protection Officer or another contact point from whom more information can be obtained;
- the likely consequences of the data breach;
- the measures that we will or might take to address the personal data breach; and
- the steps the individuals should take to protect themselves.

If notifying data subjects directly would involve a disproportionate effort, the Privacy Officer shall make a public communication regarding the breach. Otherwise, the Privacy Officer shall make the notification directly to the data subjects, including, for example, by email.

## Reporting a breach to the controller

If we suffer a breach of personal data and we are a processor of the personal data, the Privacy Officer shall notify the controller of the breach without undue delay, but after reviewing the relevant data-processing agreement with the the Legal Team.

# HIPAA Business Associate Breach Reporting
If as a result of a security or privacy incident we experience a breach of unsecured protected health information (PHI), the Privacy Team shall notify the relevant covered entities of the breach without unreasonable delay, and not later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach, unless instructed to delay the notification by an appropriate law enforcement official.

The Privacy Team shall include the following information in the notice to the covered entity (to the extent possible):

- the identification the individuals whose unsecured PHI was involved in the breach or that we believe was involved in the breach;
- a description of the incident;
- the date of the breach;
- the date of the discovery of the breach (if known); and
- a description of the types of unsecured PHI that were involved in the breach.
