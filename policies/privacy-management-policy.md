# Privacy by Design and Default

We shall ensure that in-scope personal data is:

- processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject;
- collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes;
- limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes of processing;
- accurate;
- kept in a form that permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; and
- processed in a manner that ensures the data’s integrity and confidentiality.

We shall, at the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organization measures that are designed to implement the data-protection principles outlined above.

# Prohibition on Processing Personal Data Absent a Lawful Basis

We shall only process EU personal data after we have confirmed that the processing is consistent with the GDPR. At a minimum this includes the following.

- the Privacy Team shall ensure that if we are processing the data on behalf of a controller, that we have entered into the appropriate Data Processing Agreement;
- the Privacy Team shall ensure that we received consent to send marketing emails or use cookies prior to engaging in those activities;
- the Privacy Team shall confirm that we have a lawful basis for our processing activities prior to engaging in them;
- the Privacy Team shall ensure that we do not process special categories of data (including data related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, health, a natural person’s sex life, or a natural person’s sexual orientation), unless we have a lawful basis that permits us to; and
- the Privacy Team shall ensure that we don’t engage in automated decision-making unless those activities are consistent with the limitations outlined in the GDPR.

# Documentation of our Processing Activities

Prior to engaging in any processing activities, the Privacy Team shall log information about the processing activities in the Data Use Inventory. At a minimum, this should include the following.

- a description of the processing activities;
- whether we are a data controller or a data processor as to the processing;
- the purposes of the processing;
- the categories of data subjects;
- the categories of personal data;
- the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed; and
- if the data will be transferred outside of the EU, the location of where it is being transferred and the safeguards in place to protect the data (if applicable).

The Privacy Team shall review the Data Use Inventory at least annually in order to ensure that it is complete and accurate.

# Data Protection Impact Assessments

For processing activities for which we are the data controller, the Privacy Team shall determine whether we need to perform a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) before any processing begins. A DPIA is required when the new processing activity is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

If we determine that it needs to perform a DPIA, the Privacy Team shall analyze the processing activity, and determine whether the activity is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, as required under Article 35 of the GDPR.

If the DPIA indicates that the processing activity would result in a high risk to the data subjects despite controls in place to mitigate the risks, the Privacy Team shall consult with the relevant supervisory authority before the processing commences. We shall follow the written advice received from the supervisory authority.

The Privacy Team shall document the results of the DPIA.


# GDPR

## GDPR Scope
In order to comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), we have adopted the policies outlined below.

These policies apply to all of our processing activities related to personal data, and cover all of our information systems and workforce members. For the purposes of these policies, “personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person in the European Union (EU), regardless of where the collection occurs.

## Designation of an EU Representative
We shall designate an EU representative that is established in one of the EU member states in which data subjects whose personal data we process are located.

We shall ensure that all requests or notifications from supervisory authorities and data subjects are addressed to the EU representative in addition to us.

## GDPR Data Transfers
Before transferring personal data from the EU to a third country (including the United States) or to an international organization, the Privacy Team shall ensure that an appropriate data-transfer mechanism is in place. This may include any of the following:

- an adequacy decision (such as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework or the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (if we have self-certified to the framework);
- the transfer is subject to appropriate safeguards (including, for example, a Data Processing Agreement that includes the Standard Contractual Clauses, an agreement between the relevant public authorities, or Codes of Conduct approved by the European Commission);
- approved binding corporate rules;
- the transfer relates to a judgment of a court or tribunal, and based on an international agreement; or
- the transfer is of one of the types of transfers that meet the specific conditions described in [GDPR Article 49](https://www.aptible.com/gdpr/articles/49-derogations-for-situations/).

Once an appropriate and sufficient data-transfer mechanism is in place, the Privacy Team may approve the transfer. If none of the transfer mechanisms listed above is present, the Privacy Team shall not approve the data transfer, and shall ensure that we do not engage in the transfer.



## GDPR Requests from Data Subjects Policy

### Responding to Requests

The Privacy Team shall timely respond to requests from data subjects related to their personal data, as required by the GDPR. This includes:

- objections to processing activities;
- requests to restrict the processing of personal data;
- requests to transfer personal data;
- requests to rectify personal data;
- request to access personal data; and
- requests to erase personal data.

### Timeframe for Responding

By default, the Privacy Team should respond to the individual within 28 calendar days. If the request is complex or if we've received a number of requests from the same data subject, the Privacy Team may extend the response period by two months. In that case, the Privacy Team shall give the individual notice of the extension within the original 28 days.

### Documentation

The Privacy Team shall log the following about all requests received:

- the date of the request;
- the type of request;
- the date of our response (if any); and
- the details of the actions we took (if any).


# CCPA

## Restriction on the Sale of Personal Information Policy

We shall not sell personal information about consumers unless the sale complies with the CCPA.

The Privacy Team shall ensure that, prior to the sale personal information, none of the consumers whose information is involved in the sale directed us not to sell his or her information. If the Privacy Team discovers that consumers have previously opted out, the Privacy Team shall ensure that those consumers' personal information is not sold unless the consumers give us subsequent explicit authorization to do so.

In all cases, the Privacy Team shall ensure that the following information is not included in the sale of personal information:

- personal information of consumers who we know are less than 13 years old and for whom we did not receive explicit authorization for the sale (from the consumers' parent or guardian); and
- personal information of consumers who we know are between the ages of 13 and 16, and for whom we did not receive explicit authorization for the sale (from the consumers).

## Antidiscrimination Policy

We shall refrain from discriminating against consumers who exercise any of their CCPA consumer rights. Specifically, unless an exception applies, we shall not, as a consequence of a consumer exercising a right under the CCPA, do any of the following:

- deny goods or services to the consumer;
- charge the consumer different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;
- provide a different level or quality of goods or services to the consumer; or
- suggest that the consumer will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

We may charge a consumer a different price or rate, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services to the consumer, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to us by the consumer’s data.

Further, we may offer financial incentives, including payments to consumers as compensation, for the collection of personal information, the sale of personal information, or the deletion of personal information.

## Documentation of our Processing Activities

We shall log all of our uses of personal information in the Data Use Inventory. At a minimum, we shall log the following:

- the categories of personal information we have collected;
- the specific pieces of personal information we have collected;
- the categories of our sources of the personal information;
- our purposes for collecting or selling personal information; and
- the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.

The Privacy Team shall review the Data Use Inventory at least annually in order to ensure that it is complete and accurate.

## Responding to Requests

The Privacy Team shall timely respond to requests from individuals related to their personal information, as required under the CCPA. This includes:

- requests to disclose of the personal information collected;
- requests to delete personal information;
- requests for personal information sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and
- requests to opt-out.

## Timeframe for Responding

By default, the Privacy Team should respond to individuals within 45 calendar days. If reasonably necessary, the Privacy Team may provide notice of delay to the requesting individual, and extend the response period by an additional 45 days.

## Documentation

The Privacy Officer shall log the following information about all requests received:

- the date of the request;
- the type of request;
- the date of our response (if any); and
- the details of the actions we took (if any).

# Privacy Notice Policy

We shall create and publish on our website a Privacy Notice in order to provide information about our processing activities. The Privacy Team shall work with the Legal Team to ensure that the Privacy Notice complies with the requirements listed in the GDPR, CCPA and HIPAA.

We shall review and update the Privacy Notice at least annually. During each review, the Privacy Team and the Legal Team shall work to ensure that the Privacy Notice accurately reflects our practices, and complies with all applicable laws and regulations.

# Opt Out Notice Policy

In order to ensure that all consumers are aware of their ability to opt out of any potential sale of their personal information, we shall provide an easy-to-find link titled “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” on our homepage and all pages that collect personal information about consumers, which links to a page that allows consumers to opt out of the sale of personal information. We shall not require consumers to create an account to opt out of the sale of their personal information.

# HIPAA Business Associate Data Processing

## Background

In order to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") requirements imposed on business associates, we have adopted the policies outlined below.

These policies apply to all of our processing activities related to the data we collect when we act as a business associate, as defined in HIPAA, including protected health information ("PHI").

## Use and Disclosure of PHI

We shall only use (internally) or disclose (to third parties) PHI as permitted under HIPAA or any applicable business associate agreements ("BAAs"). Any use or disclosure of PHI not expressly permitted or required by HIPAA or our BAAs is prohibited.

Before any new processing activity begins, the Privacy Team shall work with the Legal Team to ensure that we are meeting all of our requirements. At a minimum, the Privacy Team shall confirm the following:

- the use is consistent with HIPAA's requirements on business associates; and
- the use is permitted under the relevant business associate agreement (BAA).

The Privacy Team shall log the following information about all disclosures of PHI:

- the date of the disclosure;
- the name of the entity or person who received the PHI;
- the address of the entity or person who received the PHI (if known);
- a brief description of the PHI disclosed; and
- a brief statement of the purpose of the disclosure, which should identify the basis for the disclosure or include a copy of the request for disclosure.

Additionally, prior to disclosing PHI to an individual, the Privacy Team shall work with the Legal Team to:

- verify the identity of the individual requesting PHI; and
- verify that the individual is authorized to access the requested PHI.

## Minimum Necessary Use and Disclosure of PHI

Workforce members shall make reasonable efforts to limit their use and disclosure of PHI to the minimum amount of information necessary to perform their authorized activities or duties.

This policy does not apply to disclosures:

- for treatment,
- to the individual,
- pursuant to patient authorization, or
- when required by law.

For internal use of PHI, we use access controls to identify and limit access to PHI.

## Notification of Impermissible Use or Disclosure of PHI

All workforce members and contractors shall immediately report unauthorized uses or disclosures of PHI to the Privacy Officer. The Privacy Officer shall notify the Legal Team and the Security Team.

# No Intimidation or Retaliation Policy

Workforce members shall never intimidate, threaten, coerce, discriminate against, or take other retaliatory action against any individual for the exercise by the individual of any right established by, or for participation in any process provided for, HIPAA, including the filing of a complaint.

If any workforce member witnesses such an act, they shall immediately report it to the Privacy Officer or the Management Team.

# No Waiver of Rights Policy

Workforce members shall never require individuals to waive their rights under HIPAA as a condition of the provision of treatment, payment, enrollment in a health plan, or eligibility for benefits.
