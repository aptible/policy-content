# Restriction on the Sale of Personal Information Policy

We shall not sell personal information about consumers unless the sale complies with the CCPA.

The Privacy Team shall ensure that, prior to the sale personal information, none of the consumers whose information is involved in the sale directed us not to sell his or her information. If the Privacy Team discovers that consumers have previously opted out, the Privacy Team shall ensure that those consumers' personal information is not sold unless the consumers give us subsequent explicit authorization to do so.

In all cases, the Privacy Team shall ensure that the following information is not included in the sale of personal information:

- personal information of consumers who we know are less than 13 years old and for whom we did not receive explicit authorization for the sale (from the consumers' parent or guardian); and
- personal information of consumers who we know are between the ages of 13 and 16, and for whom we did not receive explicit authorization for the sale (from the consumers).

# Antidiscrimination Policy

We shall refrain from discriminating against consumers who exercise any of their CCPA consumer rights. Specifically, unless an exception applies, we shall not, as a consequence of a consumer exercising a right under the CCPA, do any of the following:

- deny goods or services to the consumer;
- charge the consumer different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;
- provide a different level or quality of goods or services to the consumer; or
- suggest that the consumer will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

We may charge a consumer a different price or rate, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services to the consumer, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to us by the consumer’s data.

Further, we may offer financial incentives, including payments to consumers as compensation, for the collection of personal information, the sale of personal information, or the deletion of personal information.

# Documentation of our Processing Activities

We shall log all of our uses of personal information in the Data Use Inventory. At a minimum, we shall log the following:

- the categories of personal information we have collected;
- the specific pieces of personal information we have collected;
- the categories of our sources of the personal information;
- our purposes for collecting or selling personal information; and
- the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.

The Privacy Team shall review the Data Use Inventory at least annually in order to ensure that it is complete and accurate.

# Responding to Requests

The Privacy Team shall timely respond to requests from individuals related to their personal information, as required under the CCPA. This includes:

- requests to disclose of the personal information collected;
- requests to delete personal information;
- requests for personal information sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and
- requests to opt-out.

# Timeframe for Responding

By default, the Privacy Team should respond to individuals within 45 calendar days. If reasonably necessary, the Privacy Team may provide notice of delay to the requesting individual, and extend the response period by an additional 45 days.

# Documentation

The Privacy Officer shall log the following information about all requests received:

- the date of the request;
- the type of request;
- the date of our response (if any); and
- the details of the actions we took (if any).

# Privacy Notice Policy

We shall create and publish on our website a Privacy Notice in order to provide information about our processing activities. The Privacy Team shall work with the Legal Team to ensure that the Privacy Notice complies with the requirements listed in the CCPA.

We shall review and update the Privacy Notice at least annually. During each review, the Privacy Team and the Legal Team shall work to ensure that the Privacy Notice accurately reflects our practices, and complies with all applicable laws and regulations.

# Opt Out Notice Policy

In order to ensure that all consumers are aware of their ability to opt out of any potential sale of their personal information, we shall provide an easy-to-find link titled “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” on our homepage and all pages that collect personal information about consumers, which links to a page that allows consumers to opt out of the sale of personal information. We shall not require consumers to create an account to opt out of the sale of their personal information.
