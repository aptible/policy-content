In order to ensure that we identify and quickly respond to vulnerabilities in our systems, we have implemented this policy. The Security Officer shall coordinate all vulnerability-management activities.


# Vulnerability Identification

The security team shall update the list of information system vulnerabilities scanned every thirty (30) days or when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported.

We shall use a number of different mechanisms to make ourselves aware of vulnerabilities, including the following.

## Vulnerability Scans

The following vulnerability scans shall be run on a quarterly basis in order to identify vulnerabilities present in our code and information systems:

- web-service vulnerability scans on all applications listed in the Asset Inventory;
- network-vulnerability scans on all of our networks; and
- host-vulnerability scans on all of our hosts.

If as a result of the vulnerability scanning we discover vulnerabilities, the Security Team shall respond to them in accordance with the response requirements below.

## Penetration Testing

We shall perform penetration testing at least annually in order to identify vulnerabilities in our systems. The Security Team shall coordinate with other teams as needed (including the Engineering Team and the Management Team) to schedule and complete penetration testing such that it does not disrupt other business operations.

If as a result of the penetration testing we discover vulnerabilities, the Security Team shall respond to them in accordance with the response requirements below.

## Responsible Disclosure Program

In order to encourage outside parties to responsibly report vulnerabilities, we have created a responsible-disclosure program, under which actual or suspected vulnerabilities identified by outside parties should be reported to the Security Team.

If as a result of the responsible-disclosure program we discover vulnerabilities, the Security Team shall respond to them in accordance with the response requirements below.

## News Sources

In order to identify new security vulnerabilities, the Security Team shall actively monitor the following sources.

- The [National Cyber Awareness System](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas)
- The [Openwall oss-security mailing list](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/)
- News sources, such as Hacker News and Krebs on Security
- Vendor security announcements (including AWS, NGiNX, OpenSSL, PostgreSQL, Ruby)

If we learn of new vulnerabilities that we are subject to from a news source, the Security Team shall respond to them in accordance with the response requirements below.

# Vulnerability Assessment and Response

Whenever we are made aware of a vulnerability, we shall classify it, track it, and take some action as to it (either remediate it or determine that we don't need to remediate it).

In addition, we shall review historic audit logs in order to determine if critical or high vulnerabilities have been previously exploited.

All identified vulnerabilities shall be classified—and responded to—based on the following severity levels:

- **Within 24 hours: Critical-severity vulnerabilities.** This includes vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to easily gain control of numerous systems; to compromise one or more systems containing Sensitive/Regulated Information; or to cause widespread service interruption.
- **Within 7 days: High-severity vulnerabilities.** This includes vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to gain control of one or more systems. The attack may be more difficult than a Critical vulnerability, or require additional pathways, to exploit.
- **Within 30 days: Medium-severity vulnerabilities.** This includes vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive or unintentionally disclosed information on a host.
- **Within 90 days: Low-severity vulnerabilities.** This includes vulnerabilities that pose no immediate threat to our information systems.

Patches and security fixes must be applied consistent with our Secure System Development Life Cycle requirements. When possible:

- remediation actions should be tested on a non-production environment first;
- patchers should verify that the fix remediates the vulnerability in production, post-deployment; and
- the Service Reliability Team should use tools to automate the consistent installation of patches.
